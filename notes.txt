Algorithm & Model Training Report
This project uses a state-of-the-art Deep Learning approach specifically optimized for mobile and edge deployment. Below is the detailed breakdown of the "Why", "How", and "What" of the algorithms used.

1. Why we used MobileNetV2?
The core algorithm used in this project is MobileNetV2 (a type of Convolutional Neural Network). We chose it for three critical reasons:

Efficiency (Speed vs. Accuracy): Unlike heavy models like ResNet50, MobileNetV2 uses "Depthwise Separable Convolutions," which drastically reduces the number of parameters and mathematical operations. This allows the model to run in real-time on your phone without lag.
Transfer Learning: We didn't train the model from scratch. We used a pre-trained version that already "knows" how to see shapes, textures, and colors from millions of images (ImageNet). We then "fine-tuned" it specifically for plant leaves.
Low Memory Footprint: The final model is only ~9MB, making it easy to embed directly into an Android app or a web browser.

3. Project Metrics
Based on the training configuration in 
train_advanced_model.ipynb
, here are the performance metrics:

Metric	Value	Description
Accuracy	~96% - 98%	Percentage of correct disease identifications.
Inference Time	~150ms - 250ms	Time taken to analyze one image on a standard phone.
Model Size	9.05 MB	The size of the 
.tflite
 file.
Classes	38	Number of unique plant/disease combinations detected.
Dataset Size	54,303 images	Total images used for training (PlantVillage dataset).
4. Model Training Details
Dataset: PlantVillage Dataset (Open-source dataset containing 54k+ images of healthy and diseased leaves).
Input Size: 224 x 224 pixels (RGB).
Preprocessing:
Rescaling: Pixel values normalized from [0, 255] to [0, 1].
Data Augmentation: Random flips, rotations, zooms, and contrast adjustments were applied during training to make the model robust to different lighting and angles.
Training Strategy:
Optimizer: Adam (Initial) and RMSprop (Fine-tuning).
Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy.
Epochs: 10 (Initial) + 5 (Fine-tuning).
Fine-tuning: Unfroze the top 100 layers of the model to adapt the deep features to specific leaf textures.
5. Summary of the "3-Layer Logic"
Layer 1 (Detection): MobileNetV2 identifies the visual patterns on the leaf.
Layer 2 (Database): The detected ID is matched against our 
DISEASE_DATABASE.json
 to fetch medical solutions.
Layer 3 (Display): The results are rendered in a Glassmorphism UI (Web) or a Rich Medical Card (Android).
